    A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the
     mouth. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the corner of the eyes, an 
     action known as a Duchenne smile. Among humans, a smile expresses delight, sociability, 
     happiness, joy, or amusement. It is distinct from a similar but usually involuntary 
     expression of anxiety known as a grimace. Although cross-cultural studies have shown 
     that smiling is a means of communication throughout the world,[1] there are large 
     differences among different cultures, religions, and societies, with some using smiles 
     to convey confusion or embarrassment.
